### Agentic Research Loop — 2026-09-12

This release documents the current agentic design and the features added while
iterating from a parameter-tuning backtester toward a self-improving research
agent.

#### Agentic design

AgentQuant runs a bounded, evidence-producing loop:

```text
ANALYZE → HYPOTHESIZE → BACKTEST → REFLECT → STORE
              ↑                         │
              └──── retry on failure ──┘
```

- **Analyze** computes market features and classifies the current regime from
  volatility, momentum, trend, and drawdown signals.
- **Hypothesize** combines LLM reasoning, stored alpha memory, regime-aware
  grid search, and random fallback proposals.
- **Backtest** evaluates proposals with warmup enforcement, transaction costs,
  and performance metrics.
- **Reflect** applies quality gates, records falsifiable proposal claims, and
  decides whether another bounded iteration is justified.
- **Store** persists accepted evidence and reusable negative evidence for later
  runs.

The loop is intentionally bounded: every proposal has parameters, a generation
method, reasoning, confidence, and measurable outcomes. This keeps agentic
behavior comparable to deterministic baselines instead of treating free-form
LLM output as evidence by itself.

#### Iteration history

The implementation has evolved through these agentic stages:

1. **Core research platform** — multi-strategy OHLCV ingestion, feature
   engineering, realistic-cost backtesting, metrics, and dashboard views.
2. **Bounded agent loop** — explicit analyze/hypothesize/backtest/reflect/store
   nodes with retry limits and a single proposal-generation entrypoint.
3. **Regime-aware proposals** — VIX percentile and momentum regimes feed the
   prompt and parameter-grid priors.
4. **Persistent learning** — `StrategyMemory`, `AlphaStore`, and NLA memory
   retain cross-run context and successful candidates.
5. **Tool-using orchestration** — Claude-compatible tool schemas, optional
   Tavily research/sentiment search, proposal parsing, and graceful fallback to
   local generation.
6. **Harness evaluation** — falsifiable claim recording, benchmark tooling,
   generalization-gap measurements, and experimental harness evolution.
7. **Failure-aware self-improvement** — structured failure records now capture
   regime, strategy, parameters, failure mode, metric gap, and a
   counterfactual hypothesis; matched failures are injected as proposal
   constraints.
8. **Robustness evaluation** — anchored walk-forward utilities report median
   and worst-window metrics; counterfactual stress tests perturb regimes,
   volatility, outlier days, and trends.
9. **Agent observability and extension points** — trace diagnostics expose node
   counts, proposal methods, improvements, and acceptances; regime transitions
   are detectable; generated strategy source is AST-validated before registry
   registration.

#### Added

- `failure_records` SQLite table and `FailureRecord` dataclass in
  `src/research/alpha_store.py`.
- Automatic failure persistence from `reflect_node`.
- Structured failure-memory prompt context in
  `src/agent/proposal_generator.py`.
- `TraceRecorder.diagnostics()` and `.diagnostics_json()` for harness reports.
- `src/backtest/walk_forward.py` for anchored walk-forward evaluation.
- `src/backtest/stress_test.py` for counterfactual strategy stress tests.
- `RegimeChangeDetector` for recording regime-label transitions.
- `src/strategies/codegen.py` for AST validation and controlled strategy
  registration.
- `stress_test_strategy` in the agent tool registry.

#### Validation

- 70 repository tests pass after integrating the latest `main` changes.
- Unsafe generated imports are rejected before registration.
- No force-push or destructive history rewrite was used for this release.

### Added — 2026-08-28

#### Tool Registry & Orchestration System
- `src/agent/tools/registry.py` — Tool schema definitions and execution engine
  - 5 core tools: regime context, market sentiment, strategy research, parameter recommendations, quality assessment
  - JSON schema generation for Claude API compatibility
  - Tavily API integration for web search (market sentiment, strategy research)
- `src/agent/tools/orchestrator.py` — Claude tool-use loop orchestrator
  - Multi-turn tool reasoning with Claude
  - Graceful fallback if Claude/Tavily unavailable
  - Proposal parsing from JSON responses
- `src/agent/tools/evals.py` — Harness quality evaluation suite
  - `run_benchmark_to_assess_quality()` tool for self-assessment
  - Metrics: OOS Sharpe, stability, generalization gap, tool accuracy
  - Actionable recommendations for harness improvement
- Tool system documentation and integration guide (`docs/TOOL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
- Example integrations showing gradual migration paths

#### Agent Graph Enhancements
- Enhanced `hypothesize_node` with tool orchestration
  - Tries Claude tool-use first, falls back to ProposalGenerator
  - No breaking changes; tools activate automatically
  - Records tool calls in execution trace
- Enhanced `reflect_node` with falsifiable claim scoring
  - Tracks proposal accuracy (predicted vs. realized)
  - Enables harness to learn which proposals work
  - Foundation for harness self-improvement

#### Proposal Parsing
- JSON proposal parsing from Claude responses
- Integration with existing ProposalValidator
- Support for falsifiable claims in proposal reasoning
- Graceful degradation if parsing fails

#### Research Agent Design
